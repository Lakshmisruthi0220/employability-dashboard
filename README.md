## Project Overview
The **Employability Analytics Dashboard** is a Power BI-driven application created by our team, Team 10 as part of the IS-5960 Master's Research Project at Saint Louis University. It empowers software engineers and career advisors with actionable insights derived from real-time job market data, including hiring trends, salary benchmarks, employer reputation, and demand for remote work.

---

## Problem Statement
Software engineers face challenges in identifying career opportunities due to fragmented job data, lack of predictive tools, and limited guidance. This project addresses these challenges by consolidating job-related data and delivering insights through an interactive dashboard.

---

## Project Objectives
- Enable job seekers to explore high-demand job roles and industries.
- Provide salary comparisons across locations and job titles.
- Highlight reputable employers based on ratings and reviews.
- Showcase remote vs on-site trends.
- Predict future skill demands using visual analytics.

---

## Target Audience
- Software engineers (entry to senior level)
- Mid-career professionals exploring new roles
- Career advisors
- Recruitment professionals

## Dataset Information
**Source:** Kaggle - "US Software Engineer Jobs"

**Key Fields:**
- Title
- Company Name
- Location
- Salary
- Experience Level
- Contract Type
- Remote Work Model
- Employer Rating
- Review Count
- Applications Count

---

## Entity Relationship Diagram (ERD)
The ERD includes three main entities:
- **Job_Posting** (job_id, title, company_id, location, salary, remote_work_model)
- **Company** (company_id, company_name, rating, review_count, industry)
- **Job_Applicant** (applicant_id, experience_level, skills, applied_job_id)

Refer to the attached ERD for relationships and cardinalities.

---

## Data Cleaning and Validation
Data integrity was ensured through:
- **Referential Integrity Checks** (valid company-job mappings)
- **Field-Level Validation** (positive salary, valid ratings, non-null titles/locations)
- **Manual Adjustments** to standardize job titles, remove outliers, and check reputation manually

All SQL checks confirmed clean and usable data for analysis.
